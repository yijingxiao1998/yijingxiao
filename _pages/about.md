Iâ€™m currently working remotely for [Flowmingle, inc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flowmingle-live/) as a Software Engineer. Our company is developing a social networking app for users to hold and find all sorts of activities and connect. We hope we could bring warmth, happiness, fun, friendship, and courage to our users. We've already launched our product on the [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowmingle/id6468864449), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.flowmingle), and of course, we also have a [website version](https://flowmingle.live/). Please feel free to check out our product and bring any feedback or advice to us.

Besides, my career interests include Software Development, Full-Stack Development, Embedded Software Development, and some parts of the Machine Learning area. 

My timezone is based on the Pacific Time Zone, feel free to reach out to me by email at any work time in the workday.
