## Flowmingle Social Networking Application	(Nov. 2023 - Present)

* Technology
  * Language: Dart
  * Software development kit: Flutter
  * Database: Firebase
* Introduction
  * Flowmingle is a social networking application for contemporary people to meet friends online and hang out together offline. People could post any event they want and chat in real time inside APP with those joined events. The purpose of developing Flowmingle APP is to change the mental health conditions of people who experienced social restriction due to lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic and encourage people to social outside again.
*	Application launched platforms
  * iOS, Android, and website. 
* Overview
  * We used Figma to set up the prototype first and followed modern Model-View-Controller design to implement an accessibility and inclusivity product. After the user gives location permission, the explore page in APP would show any social events posted nearby users and they could change location to check out some events in other cities at any time. 
* Future works
  * We still keep developing new features in the upcoming future: the function of tipping for host, supporting more languages, recommending events by languages, applying intelligence algorithm to recommend events for user interest, and importing more local events data automatically to our APP.
* Try our APP in website: ([FLOW MINGLE](https://flowmingle.live))

## Stock Market (Sept. 2022 - Dec. 2022)

* Technology
  * Language: Java
  * Database: Firebase
* Introduction
  * The stock market application is a java application that allows a user to simulate a stock market trading platform by creating a portfolio with stocks. It allows user to create one or more portfolios with shares of one or more stocks, examine the composition of a portfolio, determine the total value of a portfolio on a certain date, and persist a portfolio so that it can be saved as a csv file and would be loaded next time the user opens the application.
* Application launched platform
  * Android
* Overview
  * In the newest version, we offer modification of portfolio (add and sell), cost basis to view total investment and glimpse of the portfolio performance. The design is based on Model-View-Controller. We get data from Alpha Vantage which provides enterprise-grade financial market data through a set of powerful and developer- friendly data APIs and spreadsheets.

## Fantasy Water Markets	(Sept. 2020 – May 2021)
* Technology
  * Front-end: JavaScript
  * Back-end: PostgreSQL database and PGAdmin 4
  * Integration: Python
* Introduction
  * In the Pacific Northwest, the distribution and management of water have been poorly allocated, which can have disastrous consequences if not resolved especially during drought years without the establishment of systems. A water market is an institution wherein individuals and organizations can voluntarily trade water rights with each other and allow those who otherwise would not have access to high-priority water rights the ability to obtain them. 
  * The purpose of the Fantasy Water Markets project is to create an application (app) that can mimic actual interactions involving water rights. The app’s users will be given data that reflect real-world scenarios, which they will use to determine how best to engage with the simulated water markets. The end goal of this project is to increase awareness of water rights and, hopefully, motivate its users to be more attentive to issues regarding water appropriation in the future.
* Application launched platform
  * Website
* Overview
  * The undergraduate capstone was looking forward to creating an online simulation tool for water market with 3 other teammates. Examining how real growers think about and interacting with water markets, how their views and behavior were affected by improved weather forecasting, and improved measurement of their water use or revised rules and regulations.
